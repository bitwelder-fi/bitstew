///
/// When you add an object extension to an instance of an Object, the instance takes the ownership
/// over the object extension. An object extension may only be attached to a single Object instance
/// at a time. You can move an object extension from an Object instance to an other by removing the
/// object extension from the source instance before adding it to the destination instance.
///
/// You can add object extensions to a meta-class of an Object by adding its meta-class to the meta
/// class of the Object. You can only add extension meta data at runtime to an unsealed dynamic meta
/// class. See MetaClass on how to add a meta-class of an object extension to the static meta-class
/// of an Object.
///
/// When you instantiate an Object through the meta-class or through the Meta library factory, all
/// the extensions added to the meta-class will be instantiated and added to the instance.
